  Thank you for visiting my site with tips and tricks and all the tools you'll need for hosting a virtual camp. As you'll notice, each page has a "theory" section at the bottom. I have created this website as an e-porfolio for part of a course for my Masters in Education. The Theory section contains references to relevant literature, stories about my experience building the site, etc. Feel free to check it out by clicking on the arrows if you're interested, but you should be able to host a site without reading any of that section too.

  Happy camping!</p><br>

We are living in odd Covid times and it's certainly normal to feel a little lost when planning for your first-ever online camp. My hope is that the steps that you'll find here will help guide you through the process. And get this: I actually found planning a virtual camp easier than an in-person one. Why?</p>
<ul class = "text-left">
<li> No paperwork</li>
<li> You can share the workload and don't have to give up a whole weekend</li>
<li> You can get a full night's sleep</li>
<li> You don't have to worry so much about many health conerns/dietary needs (obviously doesn't apply to all)</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-left">
That's secret tip #1. Tip #2 is that your girls won't get excited unless you do. Just because this is likely plan B (yes, I know you'd probably rather actually be camping), it doesn't need to feel like plan B fun. There are many different tools you can use online (see additional tools under <a href="https://eknow032.github.io/virtualcamp/platform.html">Selecting a Platform<a>) that may help you do things you might never have thought possible in person. Guiding from home will also let girls include sibblings and other family members in on the fun if they wish.
  <br><br>
This guide was created for Girl Guides of Canada (GGC) Leaders and many of the references and ideas will link back to GGC resources, but it can quite simply be used by Scouting groups, other Guiding groups, youth groups of even parents trying to plan a virtual adventure with family and/or friends.
