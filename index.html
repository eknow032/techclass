  Thank you for visiting my site with tips and tricks and all the tools you'll need for hosting a virtual camp. As you'll notice, each page has a "theory" section at the bottom. I have created this website as an e-porfolio for part of a course for my Master's in Education. The Theory section contains references to relevant literature, stories about my experience building the site, etc. Feel free to check it out by clicking on the arrows if you're interested, but you should be able to host a site without reading any of that section too.
<br><br>
  Happy camping!</p><br>

We are living in odd Covid times and it's certainly normal to feel a little lost when planning for your first-ever online camp. My hope is that the steps that you'll find here will help guide you through the process. And get this: I actually found planning a virtual camp easier than an in-person one. Why?</p>
<ul class = "text-left">
<li> No paperwork</li>
<li> You can share the workload and don't have to give up a whole weekend</li>
<li> You can get a full night's sleep</li>
<li> You don't have to worry so much about many health concerns/dietary needs (obviously doesn't apply to all)</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-left">
That's secret tip #1. Tip #2 is that your girls won't get excited unless you do. Just because this is likely plan B (yes, I know you'd probably rather actually be camping), it doesn't need to feel like plan B fun. There are many different tools you can use online (see additional tools under <a href="https://eknow032.github.io/virtualcamp/platform.html">Selecting a Platform<a>) that may help you do things you might never have thought possible in person. Guiding from home will also let girls include siblings and other family members if they wish.
  <br><br>
This guide was created for Girl Guides of Canada (GGC) Leaders and many of the references and ideas will link back to GGC resources, but it can quite simply be used by Scouting groups, other Guiding groups, youth groups of even parents trying to plan a virtual adventure with family and/or friends.

 <H5>Who I am?</h5>
 <p>My name is Elizabeth Knowles and I am a Guider with two units in Montreal, Quebec. One of the is a Guide unit (ages 9-11) and the other is a multibranch Guide, Pathfinder and Ranger unit (currently ages 11-17). I have been in Guiding since I was 9 years old and love trying new things, exploring different facets of Guiding and sharing in the Guiding sisterhood.</p>
 <H5>Why a website?</h5> 
 <p>This project involved creating some sort of e-portfolio demonstrating what I have learned in this course (Integration of Technology in Education). A website seemed like a good idea as it is easy for anyone to consult and learn from. <br><br>
I decided to program this from scratch since this is, after all, a course in thinking about and using technology. I had previously experimented a bit with HTML but was by no means comfortable with it. I figured that by learning something new about technology and using technology throughout the course, it would give me first-hand experience with the topics we were covering.
</p>
 <H5>Learning HTML, CSS and Bootstrap</h5> 
 <p>My first step involved looking for somewhere to host the website. Many sources I consulted pointed to Github so I looked it up. It’s not overly user-friendly, but there are a lot of users (thus, many people asking and answering questions), it’s free and seemed like a good first-step if ever I wanted to take this newfound interest even further after the course. <br><br>
HTML, CSS and Bootstrap became by tools. HTML is the basic language that is used to write a website and CSS (cascading style sheet) is the code that determines how different elements are displayed. Bootstrap is a CSS framework that provides bits of code – HTML and CSS - to configure various elements such as tables, menus, colours, sliders, menus, etc. <br><br>
I had never even heard of Bootstrap when I began this project, but it quickly proved incredibly helpful. I could take bits of code, modify them to suit my needs and combine them in various ways. It’s limited in terms of some choices (it provides only colours for example), but I found ways around many of them. <br><br>
Some of the most challenging parts of the website code to write were for the sliders (I experimented using them during a different assignment this semester), adding in the s’more font and linking all the pages together through the many buttons. Like in all coding, it’s often the little things that get the best of you. A simple missing semi-colon can cause hours of frustration and a typo can make you wonder why you page just won’t line up when you’ve clearly indicated “tetx-left.” <br><br>
As I progressed I became more confident and learned to take breaks when I just couldn’t figure out why something wasn’t working. I bookmarked many forums and help pages and found that there was pretty much no problem that I could have that hadn’t been had before. <br><br>
