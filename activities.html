Coming up with activities is my favourite part of camp. It's where you get to be most creative and where older girls will get most say.
<br>
<br>
Here are a few ideas but don't be afraid to see how you can transition some of your favourite regular camp activities in to ones that can be done from a distance.
<br>
<ul class="text-left">
<li><b>Girlpower:</b></li>
	<ul><li>Watch commercials and talk about how girls/women are represented</li>
    <li>Make superhero capes</li>
    <li>Make an acrostic of your name with positive attributes about yourself</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Travel across Canada:</b></li>
<ul><li>Play "can you guess what province this picture is from"</li>
    <li>Learn a traditional song from a different province</li>
    <li>Make crafty passports for your travels</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Outer Space:</b></li>
<ul><li>Create a new constellation and come up with a story about it</li>
    <li>Challenge girls to design a new planet including a world-wide set of laws</li>
    <li> Track the space station (there's an app for that!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Relax and Recharge:</b></li>
<ul><li>Make bath bombs</li>
    <li>Do some yoga/stretching</li>
    <li>Gather some craft supplies in nature</li>
<li>Colour mandalas</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p class = "text-left">
Below is a sample schedule that you can use to slot your activities into. Times will, of course, vary by age. <br><br>Items in blue need to be done by video and those in yellow should be done individually. Those uncoloured can be done either way. I like to have at least some meals together so girls can just chat and catch up, but your group can decide what works best for you. <br><br>The game night and talent show worked well for us, but again, you may find something you would prefer. <br><br></p>

<h3> Some additional considerations</h3>
<p class= "text-left">
<br>
You want everyone to have a good time at camp. You know your girls best, but you know them in your regular weekly meeting setting. Now that they're camping from home, there are a few other things you want to consider.	
</p>
<ul class= "text-left">
	<li><b>Not all girls will have equal access to supplies. </b>As much as possible, give them options and use things that are easy to come by and don't require families to go out shopping. Everyone has a varying level of comfort doing so at the moment.</li>
	<br><li><b>Families may be depending on their food for eating. </b>As much as possible, avoid using food as craft supplies unless you're making something edible. </li>
    <br><li><b>Other family members may be around. </b>Be aware that others may be listening in on conversations and/or seeing what is going on on the video. Encourage girls to face so that their camera is pointing towards a wall if possible and let them know that they are under no obligation to turn their camera on if they don't feel comfortable doing so. If girls seem uncomfortable having some conversations where they might be overheard, remind them that they can type too.</li>
